                  Most coding programs force children into rigid age-based tracks. Seven-year-olds get "beginner" material. Fourteen-year-olds get "advanced" content. Your child's actual capability? Irrelevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rite Tutor rejects this completely. We've developed three skill-based pathways that students progress through based on demonstrated mastery, not calendar age. A gifted nine-year-old might work in our advanced pathway. A fourteen-year-old who needs foundational support starts where they actually are, not where society expects them to be.
